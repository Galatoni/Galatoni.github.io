            <p>Happy birthday to the best friend and princess a girl could ask for! Love you, Abi! I hope you have a wonderful day! - Kimmie</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday Princess Abi! I hope you have a really magical one! I say that not only as a friend, but also as someone with a vested interest in making it a great one by signing this card. I really hope today is fun for you! ~Sei</p>
            <p>Happy birthday! Have a pizza to celebrate but don't get any in your eye! -- Drew</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday "Saft". I tried to get you the perfect gift but wrapping up Trunks with a big bow didn't work as he is a cartoon after all. - Amby</p>
            <p>Congratulations on levelling up! Here's to all the sick loot (and maybe new abilities??) you'll gather. Have a fantastic day! - Olly</p>
