          <h3>Newbie in the Office</h3>
          <h6>19th April 2014</h6>

          <p>
              Everyone has been there. You've done the hard part, got the degree, done the interviews (multiple rounds, maybe),
              and managed to get into work. You're there, you've finally arrived. Introductions are given and received and you
              are guided to your desk.
          </p>
          <p>
              On my desk when I first arrived was a piece of paper describing the training course that the company prescribes
              to all new starters. I looked down the list and realised something very quickly. University didn't prepare me
              for this! There were things on this list that sounded really complex, from version control through to other
              programming languages. Suffice to say - it was daunting. I switched my computer on and... wait. Whats this funny
              logo about? Ah crap! I needed to get to grips with Linux too? My knowledge of Linux was pretty useless. I knew
              how to install it and do day-to-day tasks with it, but that was about it. I liked the idea of Linux, but I just
              found myself reaching for the familiarity of my pre-installed operating system time and time again.
          </p>
          <p>
              I felt out of my depth. I felt I was setting myself up to fail. "They've made a mistake. They didn't mean
              to hire me. They must have thought I was someone else!" I'd think to myself. I didn't know back then, but this
              training course was meant to produce full stack developers from the greenest of university graduates,
              or even college students. It was meant to be tough because it covered just about every aspect of computer
              science and even project management and design techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
              It was very easy to start putting expectations on myself. I'm not the most confident of people and I had
              a wife and child counting on me actually earning money. It was a lot of pressure. I'm really lucky that the
              team I was working with put me at ease. It could have so easily gone the other way. I have a friend who
              had already been a developer for some time. Over a beer in a pub we discussed how I was doing and I explained
              what was going on. Turns out, its not uncommon. Software developers are already pretty unusual people who
              manage to turn caffeine-based products into viable business solutions. Forging these people isn't something that
              can happen overnight, or without considerable effort and patience from all involved. The guy teaching understands
              this - the learner has to figure this out.
          </p>
          <p>
              Seasoned coders will have already made tons of mistakes. The one I recall making early on can be summarised as follows:
          </p>
              <pre><code>
                  var foo = getFromBar();

                  if (foo = true) {
                    console.log("It's true!");
                  } else {
                    console.log("It's false!");
              </code></pre>
          <p>
              Spot the obvious mistake... besides the fact the variable is redundant. Yep. Comparison errors are amateur mistakes
              which is exactly what I was. Took me ages to figure out what was wrong. My boss took one look and saw it immediately.
              I was pretty embarrassed. But he also imparted some useful information on me to prevent it getting in the way in future.
              Yep, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda_conditions">Yoda Conditions.</a> Everyone makes errors like this at some
              point. The key is to leverage experience and try to prevent mistakes happening. The only failure when you're starting out
              isn't making mistakes, but failing to learn from them.
