          <h2>About The Author</h2>
          <p>
              Hi. Thanks for taking the time to read this. As you may have guessed I'm a bit of an amateur (complete with
              github page template). Anyway...
          </p>

          <h3>"Who the heck are you?"</h3>
          <p>
              I'm a 30 year old (I'll most likely never change that) software developer and I live in Scunthorpe in the
              United Kingdom. I live in my Victorian terraced house with my wife, daughter and two dogs. I'm a fan of
              independently developed computer games, computer hardware, software and project management techniques. I also
              like beer.
          </p>

          <h3>"Why 30? What happened?"</h3>
          <p>
              I actually started out in retail. It literally took my wife to ask me one day:
              <pre><code>"Do you want to do this for the rest of your life?"</code></pre>
              This shocked me - genuinely. For years I had coasted through things. I'd always loved computers. My first computer
              was an Amstrad CPC464 (green screen!) and coded my first games on that. But life got in the way of that
              and I ended up in retail for nearly 10 years. I never left my computing behind though:
              <ul>
                  <li>Amstrad CPC464</li>
                  <li>Amiga A600</li>
                  <li>Amiga A600</li>
                  <li>Amiga A1200</li>
                  <li>Amiga A500</li>
                  <li>PC (Cyrix Processor) 500mhz</li>
                  <li>Various other PC configurations...</li>

              </ul>
              When my wife first asked me, I hadn't even considered it. When she
              asked I thought hard about it - by the end of the week I'd enrolled in a degree with a university and the rest
              is history. I've only been coding now for about 10 months, and boy is it fun. Thing is, for someone of my age
              entering this industry... it can be tough.

              Now I know my situation isn't unique. I can imagine there are any number of people who have taken the plunge
              to do something like this. But for me, its been rather liberating to leave behind what I was doing and take
              the chance on this - I don't regret it one bit. I'm now in my dream job! I'm just trying to get better.
          </p>

          <h3>"What Can we Expect?"</h3>
          <p>
              What you're likely to see on here are experiences, advice and some of the knowledge that I'm managing to gain.
              What you're <b>not</b> going to see on here is perfection. I'm a simple man and I'm still very much learning
              as I go. Please catch me on twitter (<a href="twitter.com/derek_ling">@derek_ling</a>) if you twit. But otherwise,
              glad to have you around for the ride. You look lovely today.
